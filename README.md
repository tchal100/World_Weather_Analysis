## World_Weather_Analysis

# Purpose:
After completeing a "PlanMYTrip" app we were tasked with taking our app to the next level. Our Beta testers recommended a few changes.Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data. Then, identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotel,from the list of potential travel destinations. 

# Accomplishments:

We were able to use our google maps API using createing a travel route between cities as well as a marker layer map in which our app user could choose a desired route to travel. 
As we did in our previous version we allowed our user to have the ablility to choose the region and destination that best fits them.
Fianlly we were able to have our user choose routes by cities, with the ability to add in a travel mode. 

## Conclusion:
Our app was able to help users plan routes by region, city and choose the modes that best fit thier needs. The "PLANMYTRIP" app was a great success! 
This is just the begining opportunities for up and coming back packers.
